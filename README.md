# NFT Lender
This is a platform that gives the user the ability to lend another user money to buy a nft or borrow money to buy a nft. It is able to do this by using a smart contract that interacts with the ethereum blockchain. For the front end the program is going to use react js, so the user can interact with the blockchain and smart contract.
